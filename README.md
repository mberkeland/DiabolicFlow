# DiabolicFlow

Welcome to DiabolicFlow, a simple, innocent little personality analyzer, with absolutely NO nefarious intentions whatsoever.

OR IS IT?????


DiabolicFlow is a DialogFlow CX-based "Escape Room" game, submitted for the DialogFlow CX Competition, August 2021

It consists of 2 independent (but interrelated) Agents, an App (handling webhooks and detectIntents), and a GUI component.

In order to successfully complete the game, you must either have a phone that can send/receive Text messages (US-based only), OR have WhatsApp installed on your phone (any country, including US). WhatsApp is the preferred channel (it will try WA, and if that fails, and the number is US, it will revert to SMS)

Before reading any further I STRONGLY SUGGEST YOU PLAY THE GAME! The stuff in the ReadMe may contain spoilers or give away surprises, so it's best to EXPERIENCE it first, then delve into the details.

The AVERAGE game play time is about 45 minutes. So make sure you set aside enough time! However, you can always leave and come back to where you left off (instructions are given in the game). I've found that experienced Puzzle-Solvers
can get through the game significantly faster.

Note.. this is a work in progress, and I expect changes and tweaks will be made right up until the contest deadline.

ToDo: Add installation and setup instructions

ToDo: Explain gameflow and design

ToDo: Discuss challenges inherent within a multi-channel parallel-flow mind-bending adventure
